# Logseq Github Plugin
>If this plugin helps you, I'd really appreciate your support. You can [buy me a coffee here. ](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/sawhney17)

Born out of frustration with github's issue handling, this plugin allows you to *easily* pull all issues into logseq

## Features
- Custom templates, use the keywords {title}, {URL} and {body} to easily keep track of the issues and integrate it with your system
- Custom filtering of issues using githubs search operators, as long as the return value of the search is an issue, it should parse
- Does not replace previously imported items so that you can easily integrate it with your workflow, instead only adds new items

## Instructions
- Open plugins
- Click the gear icon in the logseq github plugin
- Click open settings
- Customize the options
